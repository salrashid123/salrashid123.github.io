      <description>A couple days ago i finally started to tinker with firebase storage and its rules engine.
I did know about the rules engine for many years now and knew it was pretty flexible but never really noticed that it can use both request and resource attributes. What i mean by that is a firebase rule can evaluate and grant access at runtime using both something contained within the request (eg, id_token) and something about the target being accessed (eg a resource attribute).</description>
