      <description>or &amp;ldquo;How to embed SSH private keys into a Yubikey or TPM&amp;rdquo;. First off, this is nothing new; its a rehash of decade old tech that i decided to try out since i happens to have a YubiKey Neo and familiarity with Trusted Platform Module on a GCP Shielded VM.
Both the Yubikey Neo and TPM have one common capability here which this tutorial covers: embedding an RSA private key inextricably into a hardware device and provide an interface to sign arbitrary data using that key.</description>
