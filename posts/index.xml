      <description>Nothing much, just my variation/helloworld for opentelemetry in golang..its my variation of Opentelemetry-Distributed Tracing sample
This is a simple frontend-backend application you can run on your laptop which demonstrates distributed tracing between microservices.
What step 5 below shows is an inbound request to one microservice (/frontend) which emits some subspans, then makes an http call to a backend app (/backend) which also emits some spans. The final trace you see is a combined end-to-end trace between microservices.</description>

      <description>Basic application that uses a the tpm2-tss-engine to perform RSA encryption and signatures.
This is intended to run on a system with a TPM as well as the the openssl engine library installed. The TPM-based private key is generated directly using tpm2tss-genkey and from that, the openssl engine to surface the public part. The tpm2-tss-engine surfaces the OpenSSL constructs like EVP_PKEY_RSA so you can directly use that against the TPM</description>

      <description>or &amp;ldquo;How to embed SSH private keys into a Yubikey or TPM&amp;rdquo;. First off, this is nothing new; its a rehash of decade old tech that i decided to try out since i happens to have a YubiKey Neo and familiarity with Trusted Platform Module on a GCP Shielded VM.
Both the Yubikey Neo and TPM have one common capability here which this tutorial covers: embedding an RSA private key inextricably into a hardware device and provide an interface to sign arbitrary data using that key.</description>

      <description>Sample &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; application demonstrating basic aspects fo Envoy&amp;rsquo;s Global Rate Limiting capability. This app configures a local envoy instance for an HTTP level rate limit filter and then uses Lyft&amp;rsquo;s RateLimit Service as the backend.
Envoy&amp;rsquo;s rate limit functions checks each request to see if it should go through or not either using a local instance specific criteria or globally. By local, the rate limit counter runs within the context of the single envoy proxy that handles the request.</description>

      <description>Several months ago Google Cloud Logging introduced two new monitored resource types geared towards allowing developers to emit cloud logging messages for their own application centric logs. Pereviously, application logs generally had to be tied to existing predefined monitored_resources such as GCE, GKE, AppEngine, Dataflow and so on. Under those monitoried resources sources, multiple log entries were attributed to specific logNames describing the subsystem like syslog, apache2, nginx, mysql, etc.</description>

      <description>Sample Cloud Composer (Apache Airflow) configuration to securely invoke Cloud Functions or Cloud Run.
In addition this sample shows inverse: how Cloud Functions can invoke a Composer DAG securely. While GCF-&amp;gt;Composer is documented here, the configuration detailed here is minimal and (to me), easier to read.
Anyway, the following will setup cloud composer, then we will trigger composer to invoke a cloud function&amp;hellip;the cloud function will just trigger a different cloud composer endpoint&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>I wanted to understand how to setup a standalone golang app that integrated Opencensus specifically for Tracing and Metrics. The type of tracing i was after was both automatic and between web requests. By automatic i mean if you initialize opencensus and then directly use a supporting library to access a resrouce (eg. Google Cloud Storage client), tracing information about specific actions within the GCS call is rendered (eg, time taken for each individual get/put operation).</description>

      <description>Tutorial on how to use ClamAV to scan files uploaded to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
GCS does not have any built in capability to scan or do any other type of preprocessing on its files and relies on other services to perform these steps. In this tutorial, we will process a file that gets uploaded to GCS for viruses, malware, etc using ClamAV.
Architecture The basic flow outlined here is:</description>

      <description>This is a second in a series related to a versatile feature in Cloud Scheduler and Cloud Tasks and Cloud PubSub that automatically emits google OpenIDConnect and oauth2 access_token to outbound webhook calls. When a Scheduled task fires and calls an HTTP endpoint, it can automatically carry credentials to authenticate itself. The id_token credential can then get validated at the HTTP web-hook target using well known techniques (i.,e validate the signature and aud: fields in the token).</description>

      <description>Sample flow to extract Google Container Registry usage statistics (image push/pull counts, analytics, etc). GCR images are hosted on Google Cloud Storage which does have the ability to export usage which means we can indirectly acquire GCR&amp;rsquo;s usage.
There are several step sto getting the following pipeline to work but in is basic form, we setup GCS bucket used by GCR to export its usage stats to another GCS bucket.</description>

      <description>A month ago or so I tried out a pretty versatile feature in Cloud Scheduler and Cloud Tasks and Cloud Tasks that emits OpenIDConnect or oauth2 access_token to outbound webhook calls.
When a Scheduled task fires and calls an HTTP endpoint, it can optionally automatically carry credentials for use with a GCP REST Endpoint. What does that mean? Well, you can automatically trigger most Google APIs directly do to any number of things on schedule or as a task instead of creating and running a cron elsewhere.</description>

      <description>About a year+ ago a colleague of mine (Daz Wilkin) asked me how best to decompress/unzip a file using Google Cloud Functions. The suggestion ended as a sample he provided demonstrating the stream-read-&amp;gt;stream-write pattern with the pertinent input-outputs (input: unziped file; output zipped file). The distinct advantage of stream processing the unzip function is that the data is never held in memory: as the unzipped content gets processed by GCF, its promptly written as a zip file to GCS.</description>

      <description>About two months ago, someone asked me to help them setup Terraform to automatically provision GCP projects. It was the first time I actually used it and found it capabilities pretty powerful: it&amp;rsquo;s easy to manage complex resources and maintain a picture of the state change. However, one aspect of its capabilities that struck me was its need to directly have permissions on all GCP resources it provisioned or manage.</description>

      <description>Sample procedure to use curl to make a gRPC call.
gRPC is built on top of HTTP2 and is used to make remote procedure calls using protocol buffers.
gRPC by design is fast, efficient, extensible and portable across many languages. The only real way to invoke the remote procedure is to use a generated gRPC client which internally does all the marshalling to encode the protbuf messages into gRPC&amp;rsquo;s wire format:</description>

      <description>The serviceAccountActor IAM role on Google Cloud has some very useful and powerful capabilities. It is an IAM role that allows you to grant another user or serviceAccount the ability to impersonate a service Account. In this way, you can have service account A impersonate B and acquire the access_tokens or id_tokens for B.
This article covers how you can acquire id and access tokens for service account B by service account A.</description>

      <description>This is a tutorial on how to provision users and groups from a local LDAP server (OpenLDAP) into your G Suite domain. Any users and groups present in your local LDAP server will get created in G Suite. Once your users are present in your G Suite domain, you can authorize these users and groups access to Google Cloud Resources and other G Suite features.
This article is simply a tutorial on the simplified steps you would take for your on-prem directory server (ActiveDirectory, OpenLDAP).</description>

      <description>This script acts as a GCE&amp;rsquo;s internal metadata server for local testing/emulation.
It returns a live access_token that can be used directly by Application Default Credentials transparently.
This is useful to test any script or code locally that my need to contact GCE&amp;rsquo;s metadata server for custom, user-defined variables or access_tokens.
Another usecase for this is to verify how Application Defaults will behave while running a local docker container. A local running docker container will not have access to GCE&amp;rsquo;s metadata server but by bridging your container to the emulator, you are basically allowing GCP API access directly from within a container on your local workstation (vs.</description>

I find it pretty confusing to keep track of all the various ways to access a service and that coupled with the changes in the library set accross languages, i often lose trac….so I’ve kept this repo as a running reference. Hope you find some of the samples useful.
This article will only describe the libraries in general terms but point back to a gitRepo for all the code samples.</description>
