      <description>A very limited hack to use Knative CLI cli to do basic operations on Cloud Run (managed)
I was looking at the API calls yesterday to understand how GCP&amp;rsquo;s gcloud deploys and manages an app on Cloud Run. Cloud Run at the core used Knative so i figured &amp;ldquo;how hard is it to use knative&amp;rsquo;s on CLI to manage Cloud Run?&amp;rdquo;.
Well, you can to a limited degree and with some hacks.</description>

      <description>Cheatsheet to setup Envoy to proxy Redis traffic using TLS and Redis AUTH.
I&amp;rsquo;m writing this up since i found it really tricky to setup the envoy side of things&amp;hellip;especially with both downstream and upstream AUTH:
hope this helps you spend some hours on other things..
What we&amp;rsquo;re going to do: Setup a go redis client app to talk via TLS to envoy. Envoy will then proxy requests to Redis server.</description>

      <title>Mounting CSEK protected disk with LUKS encryption on Google Compute Engine</title>

      <description>Simple procedure that attaches a GCE persistent disk to a VM where the disk itself is encrypted by a key you define (Customer Supplied Encryption Key). In addition, the startup script also does a final round of encryption on top of that on the mounted disk using LUKS. Essentially, youâ€™re left with a disk that can only get decrypted if you have both encryption keys:
For example, the Disk is encrypted with CSEK:</description>

      <description>Sample getting started tutorial on how to do traffic splitting with Knative Serving using Istio.
This is just my &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; application demonstrating stuff here:
 Knative traffic-splitting Routing and managing traffic with blue/green deployment  While you can easily follow those tutorials, this article specifically designed to deconstruct the basic knative serving objects (Services, Congigurations, Routes, Revisions) and how to use them to split traffic.
  Note: GCP Cloud RUn does not yet suport tags</description>

      <title>Google Cloud KMS based Service Accounts for Authentication and SignedURLs</title>

      <description>The following procedure details how to embed a Google Cloud KMS key as a Service Account.
There are two ways to associate a Service Account with a KMS key:
 Create a private key within KMS and then associate a Service Account with it. or Create a Service Account keypair; export the private key and import that key into KMS.  Once the Serivce Account private key is within KMS, you can do several things:</description>

      <title>Simple distributed tracing with OpenTracing and Stackdriver</title>

      <description>Nothing much, just my variation/helloworld for opentelemetry in golang..its my variation of Opentelemetry-Distributed Tracing sample
This is a simple frontend-backend application you can run on your laptop which demonstrates distributed tracing between microservices.
What step 5 below shows is an inbound request to one microservice (/frontend) which emits some subspans, then makes an http call to a backend app (/backend) which also emits some spans. The final trace you see is a combined end-to-end trace between microservices.</description>

      <title>GCS SignedURL with Google AppEngine Standard (1st gen)</title>

      <description>Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve repeatedly had to setup samples that use Google AppEngine&amp;rsquo;s (v1) to generate a SignedURL.
The following is nothing new but my variation of it (since i just had to do this again from scratch)
Sample code demonstrating GCS SignedURL using original-flavor Appengine (v1).
Note, if your&amp;rsquo;e reading this and your&amp;rsquo;e using Cloud Run, Cloud Functions or AppEngine v2, its much, much eaiser: just use the google-cloud-storage python library</description>

      <description>12/30/19: NOTE: as you can clearly tell, this article is dated. DO NOT use this (i&amp;rsquo;m leavig it up as a matter of record)
 Sample code demonstrating running trivial .NET web applications on Google Cloud Platform services.
These simply builds off of existing technologies and samples but configures it to run on GCP effeciently with healh checking and load balancing.
The example here uses Microsofts&amp;rsquo;s .NET Core 1.</description>
